CHECK IF A CLIENT IS USING A VPN OR PROXY WITH PHP

I am developing an e-commerce website with PHP for a client who insists that customers who use VPN should be blocked from accessing the website. 
I therefore came up with the code that checks for the same and is 99% effective. It has three functionalities:

1. Checks Proxy headers
2. Checks Proxy Ports
3. Check the IP address quality score from ipqualityscore.com (You will need to get a free API key from ipqualityscore.com)

Feel free to try out with VPN On and VPN off

To use it include it in your PHP files.
